1. **Pick the right task:** to achieve a flow state, you need to find the right balance between the challenge of the activity and your own skills levels. The flow state rises from a tension between the two. You won’t be able to get in the zone if the task is too easy or too difficult.
2. **Define your goal:** you need a clearly defined end goal to get in the flow. If you keep interrupting your work to wonder what should happen next, you won’t be able to lose your self-consciousness.
3. **Cut out distractions:** this means no phone, no multitasking, only the necessary tools (so closing the tabs you don’t need, or closing your laptop if you’re doing non-digital work), and making sure your belly is full and you had enough sleep.
4. **Take a deep breath:** focus on the present moment, accept that you may fail, and let go of your ego. Do not think about the present or the future.
5. **Work mindfully:** keep your mind fully attentive to what you are working on in that moment. Similar to what you would do when meditating, gently bring back your mind to the task at hand if you feel like it’s wandering or slipping off into autopilot mode.
