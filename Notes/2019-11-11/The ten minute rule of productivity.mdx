> The Ten Minute Rule of productivity is about “tricking” your limbic system by talking yourself into getting started. Instead of focusing on the outcome, it’s about focusing on the output. Avoid overplanning and overthinking. Don’t say you’ll read a chapter of that book; say you’ll read for ten minutes. Don’t say you’ll run a 5K; say you’ll run for ten minutes. Don’t say you’ll build a new feature; say you’ll code for ten minutes.
