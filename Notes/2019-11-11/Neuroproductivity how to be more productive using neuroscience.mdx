> Three main neurochemicals have been identified in people experiencing a state of flow—the zen-like meditative state where we’re mentally free to execute and apply our skills with no distracting thought whatsoever inside our mind. These are dopamine, noradrenaline, and acetylcholine. As you will see, it’s a complex system that’s worth understanding.

...

> When it comes to productivity, dopamine is a double-edged sword. It can increase or decrease your productivity depending on what exactly triggers the reward system. Let’s say you get a notification on your phone and see someone liked your latest Tweet. Boom, a small hit of dopamine. Now, let’s say you check how many words you wrote in the last hour, or finally get a new feature to work in your app. Boom, you’ll also get a hit of dopamine.

...

> The second neurochemical is noradrenaline (also called norepinephrine in the United States). It’s a neurotransmitter that’s involved in the fight-or-flight response, and it makes you more alert and vigilant. While chronic stress is damaging, the right amount of pressure can be beneficial in order to increase your productivity. This is why many procrastinators report performing better when a deadline is approaching.

...

> Acetylcholine is the third neurochemical of productivity. It was the first neurotransmitter ever discovered and is abundant in the nervous system. Besides being involved in the autonomic nervous system—all of the involuntary and unconscious activity in your body such as heart rate, digestion, or respiration—it also plays an important role in focus, learning, and memory.
> In terms of neuroproductivity, an acetylcholine deficiency often means that you’ll have trouble focusing your attention and remembering things, and damage to the cholinergic system—the system in the brain that produces acetylcholine—has been found to be associated with the memory deficits we observe in Alzheimer’s disease. On the other hand, studies found that increased acetylcholine levels have a positive impact on performance.
