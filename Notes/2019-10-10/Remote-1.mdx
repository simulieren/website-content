> “Release yourself from the 9am-to-5pm mentality. It might take a bit of time and practice to get the hang of working asynchronously with your team, but soon you’ll see that it’s the work—not the clock—that matters.”

Excerpt From: Fried, Jason; Heinemeier Hansson, David. “Remote : Office Not Required”.
