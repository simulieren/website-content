A simple formula for making a value-driven decision. This can be easily applied to design, engineering or other topics.

## `Return Of Invest = Business Value / Required Effort`

If the `Effort` is low and the `Business Value` is high, then the `ROI` will be high.

Positive Example: `BV = 10`, `RE = 1` equals to `ROI = 10`.

Negative Example: `BV = 5`, `RE = 3` equals to `ROI = 1.66...`
